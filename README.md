[WIP] Read Eval Edit Loop: A REPL that is also a text editor

Nobody ordered this, and I have no idea if it will even work. When I attempt to explain it, I'll likely receive blank stares and perhaps a "Why?", so bear with me. To fully appreciate this, we're gonna have to take a brief detour to learn a little about the history of text editors.

TODO!!
(haha, cliffhanger for now... I need sleep)
